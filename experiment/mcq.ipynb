      "{'text': \"Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.[1] Recently, generative artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.[2][3]\\n\\nMachine learning approaches have been applied to many fields including large language models (LLM), computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine, where it is too costly to develop algorithms to perform the needed tasks.[4][5] ML is known in its application across business problems under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.\\n\\nThe mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning.[7][8] From a theoretical point of view Probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\", 'number': 5, 'subject': 'machine learning', 'tone': 'simple', 'response_json': '{\"1\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"2\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"3\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"4\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}}', 'quiz': '{\\n    \"1\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"What is the main focus of machine learning?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Developing and studying statistical algorithms\",\\n            \"b\": \"Creating explicit instructions for tasks\",\\n            \"c\": \"Exploring data through unsupervised learning\",\\n            \"d\": \"Optimizing mathematical foundations\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"a\"\\n    },\\n    \"2\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"Which field has machine learning NOT been applied to?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Large language models\",\\n            \"b\": \"Agriculture\",\\n            \"c\": \"Music composition\",\\n            \"d\": \"Medicine\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"c\"\\n    },\\n    \"3\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"What provides the mathematical foundations for machine learning?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Data mining\",\\n            \"b\": \"Mathematical optimization\",\\n            \"c\": \"Predictive analytics\",\\n            \"d\": \"Generative artificial neural networks\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"b\"\\n    },\\n    \"4\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"Which framework describes machine learning from a theoretical point of view?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Parallel learning\",\\n            \"b\": \"Exploratory data analysis\",\\n            \"c\": \"Probably approximately correct (PAC) learning\",\\n            \"d\": \"Statistical algorithms\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"c\"\\n    },\\n    \"5\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"What is the main goal of machine learning algorithms?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Generalize to unseen data\",\\n            \"b\": \"Follow explicit instructions\",\\n            \"c\": \"Focus only on supervised learning\",\\n            \"d\": \"Avoid data analysis\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"a\"\\n    }\\n}', 'review': '{\\n    \"1\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"What is machine learning focused on?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Developing and studying statistical algorithms\",\\n            \"b\": \"Creating explicit instructions for tasks\",\\n            \"c\": \"Ignoring data and generalizing to unseen data\",\\n            \"d\": \"Not applicable to artificial intelligence\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"a\"\\n    },\\n    \"2\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"Which field has machine learning been applied to?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Astronomy\",\\n            \"b\": \"Medicine\",\\n            \"c\": \"Music\",\\n            \"d\": \"Fashion\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"b\"\\n    },\\n    \"3\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"What is an important source of machine learning methods?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Artificial intelligence\",\\n            \"b\": \"Computational statistics\",\\n            \"c\": \"Quantum computing\",\\n            \"d\": \"Blockchain\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"b\"\\n    },\\n    \"4\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"What is the related field that focuses on exploratory data analysis?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Data visualization\",\\n            \"b\": \"Data mining\",\\n            \"c\": \"Data encryption\",\\n            \"d\": \"Data compression\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"b\"\\n    },\\n    \"5\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"Which framework provides a theoretical point of view for describing machine learning?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Deep learning\",\\n            \"b\": \"Machine vision\",\\n            \"c\": \"Probably approximately correct (PAC) learning\",\\n            \"d\": \"Natural language processing\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"c\"\\n    }\\n}'}\n"
